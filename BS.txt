must 
learn:   1. HTML to define the content of web pages   2. CSS to specify the layout of web pages   3. JavaScript to program the behavior of web pages Web pages are not the only place where JavaScript is used.
Many desktop and server programs use JavaScript. Node.js is the best known. 
Some databases, like MongoDB and CouchDB, also use JavaScript as their programming language.JavaScript and Java are completely different languages, both in concept 
and design.JavaScript was invented by Brendan Eich in 1995, and became an ECMA standard  
in 1997.ECMA-262 is the official name of the standard. ECMAScript is the official name of the language.
You can read more about the different JavaScript versions in the chapter

RED ,
GREEN ,
BLUE ).Each parameter defines the intensity of the color as an integer between 0 and 255.For example, rgb(0,0,255) is rendered as blue, 
because the blue parameter is set to its highest value (255) and the others are set to 0.Shades of gray are often defined using equal values for all the 3 light sources:Hexadecimal color values are also supported in all browsers.A hexadecimal color is specified with:
#RRGGBB.RR (red), GG (green) and BB (blue) are hexadecimal integers between 00 and 
FF specifying the intensity of the color.For example, #0000FF is displayed as blue, because the blue component is set to its highest value (FF) and the others are set to 
00.Shades of gray are often defined using equal values for all the 3 light sources:You can use upper case or lower case letters to specify hexadecimal values.
Lower case are easier to write. Upper case are easier to read.CSS supports 140 standard color names.In the next chapter you will find a complete alphabetical list of color names

XMLYour message has been sent to W3Schools.The HTML <canvas> element is used to draw graphics on a web page.The graphic above is created with <canvas>.It shows four elements: a red rectangle, a gradient rectangle,
a multicolor rectangle, and a multicolor text.The HTML <canvas> element is used to draw graphics, on the fly, via scripting (usually JavaScript).The <canvas> element is only a container for graphics. You must use a script to actually draw the graphics.Canvas has several methods for drawing paths, boxes, circles, text, and adding images.The numbers in the table specify the first browser version that fully supports the 
<canvas> element.Canvas can draw colorful text, with or without animation. Canvas has great features for graphical data presentation with an imagery of 
graphs and charts. Canvas objects can move. Everything is possible: from simple bouncing balls 
to complex animations.Canvas can respond to 
JavaScript events.Canvas can respond to any user action (key clicks, mouse 
clicks, button clicks, finger movement).Canvas' methods for animations, offer a lot of possibilities for HTML gaming 
applications.In HTML, a <canvas> element looks like this:The <canvas> element must have an id attribute so it can be referred to by JavaScript.The width and height attribute is necessary to define the size of the canvas.Tip: You can have multiple <canvas> elements on one HTML page.By default, the <canvas> element has no border and no content.To add a border, use a style attribute:The next chapters show how to draw on the canvas.

server and displays it:AJAX = Asynchronous JavaScript And
XML.AJAX is not a programming language.AJAX just uses a combination of:AJAX is a misleading name. AJAX applications might use XML to transport data,
but it is equally common to transport data as plain text or JSON text.AJAX allows web pages to be updated asynchronously by exchanging data with a web server behind the scenes.
This means that it is possible to update parts of a web page, without reloading the whole page.

only ONE <h1> element you still have to specify the array index [0], 
because the getElementsByTagName() method always returns an array. 
You can learn a lot more about the HTML DOM in our 
JavaScript tutorial.
All XML elements can be accessed through the XML DOM.The XML DOM is:In other words: The XML DOM is a standard for how to get, change, add, or delete XML elements.This code retrieves the text value of the first <title> element in an 
XML document:The XML file used in the examples below is books.xml.This example reads "books.xml" into xmlDoc and retrieves the text value of the first <title> element in 
books.xml:This example loads a text string into an XML DOM object, and  
extracts the info from it with JavaScript:The DOM models XML as a set of node objects. The nodes can be accessed with 
JavaScript or other programming languages. In this tutorial we use JavaScript.The programming interface to the DOM is defined by a set standard properties 
and methods.Properties are often referred to as something that is (i.e. nodename 
is "book").Methods are often referred to as something that is done (i.e. delete 
"book").These are some typical DOM properties:Note: In the list above, x is a node object.Note: In the list above, x is a node object.

XMLYour message has been sent to W3Schools.An XML Schema describes the structure of an XML document.The XML Schema language is also referred to as XML Schema Definition (XSD).The purpose of an XML Schema is to define the legal building blocks of an XML
document:In the XML world, hundreds of standardized XML formats are in daily use. Many of these XML standards are defined by XML Schemas.XML Schema is an XML-based (and more powerful) alternative to DTD.One of the greatest strength of XML Schemas is the support for data types.Another great strength about XML Schemas is that they are written in XML.XML Schemas are extensible, because they are written in XML.With an extensible Schema definition you can:When sending data from a sender to a receiver, it is essential that both parts
have the same "expectations" about the content.With XML Schemas, the sender can describe the data in a way that the receiver
will understand.A date like: "03-11-2004" will, in some countries, be interpreted as 3.November
and in other countries as 11.March.However, an XML element with a data type
like this:<date type="date">2004-03-11</date>ensures a mutual understanding of the content, because the XML data type "date"
requires the format "YYYY-MM-DD".A well-formed XML document is a document that conforms to the XML syntax
rules, like:Even if documents are well-formed they can still contain errors, and those errors can have serious consequences.Think of the following situation: you order 5 gross of laser printers, instead of 5 laser
printers. With XML Schemas, most of these errors can be caught by your
validating software.

Many desktop and server programs use JavaScript. Node.js is the best known. 
Some databases, like MongoDB and CouchDB, also use JavaScript as their programming language.JavaScript and Java are completely different languages, both in concept 
and design.JavaScript was invented by Brendan Eich in 1995, and became an ECMA standard  
in 1997.ECMA-262 is the official name of the standard. ECMAScript is the official name of the language.

text.JSON is text, and we can convert any JavaScript object into JSON, and send 
JSON to the server.We can also convert any JSON received from the server into JavaScript 
objects.This way we can work with the data as JavaScript objects, with no complicated 
parsing and translations.If you have data stored in a JavaScript object, you can convert the object 
into JSON, and send it to a server:You will learn more about the JSON.stringify() function later in this tutorial.If you receive data in JSON format, you can convert it into a JavaScript 
object:You will learn more about the JSON.parse() function later in this tutorial.When storing data, the data has to be a certain format, and regardless of where you choose to store it, 
text is always one of the legal formats.JSON makes it possible to store JavaScript objects as text.Storing data in local storage*JSON uses JavaScript syntax, but the JSON format is text only.Text can be read and used as a data format by any programming 
language.The JSON format was originally specified by
Douglas Crockford.Since the JSON format is text only, it can easily be sent to and from a 
server, and used as a data format by any programming language.JavaScript has a built in function to convert a string, written in JSON format, into native 
JavaScript objects:JSON.parse()So, if you receive data from a server, in JSON format, you can use it like 
any other JavaScript object.

size computer.It is developed by the Raspberry Pi Foundation, and it might be the most 
versatile tech ever created.Creator Eben Upton's goal was to create a low-cost device that would improve 
programming skills and hardware understanding.Due to the small size and price of the device, it has become the center of a 
wide range of projects by tinkerers, makers, and electronics enthusiasts.The Raspberry Pi has a row of GPIO (General Purpose input/output) pins, and 
these can be used to interact in amazing ways with the real world. This tutorial 
will focus on how to use these with Node.js.For this tutorial you need a Raspberry Pi. In our examples we use a Raspberry Pi 3, 
but this tutorial should work for most versions.Hardware needed:For later chapters in this tutorial we will use special sensors or devices 
that we connect to the Raspberry Pi. We will specify these as special 
requirements in the relevant chapters.If you already have a Raspberry Pi set up with Raspbian, internet and enabled 
SSH, you can skip to the step "Install Node.js on Raspberry Pi".Before we can start using our Raspberry Pi for anything, we need to get a OS 
installed.Raspbian is a free operating system based on Debian Linux, and it is 
optimized Raspberry Pi.Download the latest Raspbian image from https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/ 
to your computer.We use the "LITE" version in our tutorial, since we are setting the Raspberry 
Pi up as a headless server (we will connect to it through SSH, without having a 
keyboard/display connected to it). You can use whichever version you want, but 
this tutorial is written with the "LITE" version as its focus.Insert the MicroSD memory card in your computer (via the SD adapter if 
needed). 
Open File Explorer to verify that it is operational.Etcher is a program for flashing images to memory cards. Download and 
install Etcher from: https://etcher.io/Launch Etcher:Click "Select image" button and find the Raspbian zip file that 
you downloaded.Click the "Select drive" button and specify the memory card as the target location.Click the "Flash!" button to write the image to the memory card.After Etcher is finished writing the image to the memory card, remove it from your computer.To get the Raspberry Pi ready to boot we need to:When the Raspberry Pi is finished booting up, log in using username: pi and password: raspberryIf you will use a Ethernet cable to connect your Raspberry Pi to the 
internet, you can skip this step.For this section we will assume you have a Raspberry Pi 3, with built in 
WiFi.Start by scanning for wireless networks:This will list all of the available WiFi networks. (It also confirms that 
your WiFi is working)Now we need to open the wpa-supplicant file, to add the network you want to 
connect to:This will open the file in the Nano editor. Add the following to the bottom 
of the file (change wifiName and wifiPassword with the actual network name and 
password):Press "Ctrl+x" to save the code. Confirm with "y", and confirm the name with "Enter".And reboot the Raspberry Pi:After reboot, log in again, and confirm that the WiFi is connected and working:If the WiFi is working propery, the information displayed should include an 
IP address, similar to this:Write down that IP address, as we will use it to connect to the Raspberry Pi 
via SSH.Now your Raspberry Pi is connected to the internet, it is time to enable SSH.SSH allows you up use the Raspberry Pi without having a monitor and keyboard 
connected to it.(You will need a SSH client for this on your non-Raspberry Pi computer. We use 
PuTTY for windows)Open the Raspberry Pi Software Configuration Tool:You should see a menu like this:Select option 5 Interfacing Options:Select option P2 SSH, to activate SSH:Confirm with YES, to activate SSH:SSH is now enabled, and you should be in the main menu again.Select 1 Change User Password, and follow the instructions to change the password. Choose a secure password, but something you will remember:After you have finished changing the password, you should be back in the main menu.Select 2 Hostname, and follow the instructions to change the hostname:After you have finished changing the hostname, you should be back in the main menu.Now we will close the menu and save the changes:When selecting Finish, you will get the option to reboot. Select Yes to reboot the Raspberry Pi.You can now unplug the monitor and keyboard from the Raspberry Pi, and we can log in using out SSH client.Open PuTTY, type in the IP address for your Raspberry Pi, and click Open:Log in using the username pi and the new password you specified.You should now see a command line like this: (we used w3demopi as our hostname)You are now able to run your Raspberry Pi in "Headless-mode", meaning you do not need a monitor or keyboard. And if you have a WiFi connection, you do not need a ethernet cable either, just the power cable!With the Raspberry Pi properly set up, login in via SSH, and update your Raspberry Pi system packages to their latest versions.Update your system package list:Upgrade all your installed packages to their latest version:Doing this regularly will keep your Raspberry Pi installation up to date.To download and install newest version of Node.js, use the following command:Now install it by running:Check that the installation was successful, and the version number of 
Node.js with:Now you have a Raspberry Pi with Node.js installed!If you want to learn more about Node.js, follow our tutorial:

The HTML page contains a <div> section and a <button>.The <div> 
section is used to display information from a server.The <button> calls a function (if it is clicked).The function requests data from a web 
server and displays it:AJAX = Asynchronous JavaScript And
XML.AJAX is not a programming language.AJAX just uses a combination of:AJAX is a misleading name. AJAX applications might use XML to transport data,
but it is equally common to transport data as plain text or JSON text.AJAX allows web pages to be updated asynchronously by exchanging data with a web server behind the scenes.
This means that it is possible to update parts of a web page, without reloading the whole page.

content, structure, and style of a document."The HTML DOM defines a standard way for accessing and manipulating HTML documents. 
It presents an HTML document as a tree-structure.The XML DOM defines a standard way for accessing and manipulating XML documents. 
It presents an XML document as a tree-structure.Understanding the DOM is a must for anyone working with HTML or XML.
All 
HTML elements can be accessed through the HTML DOM.This example changes the value of an HTML element with id="demo":This example changes the value of the first <h1> element in an HTML document:Note: Even if the HTML document contains 
only ONE <h1> element you still have to specify the array index [0], 
because the getElementsByTagName() method always returns an array. 
You can learn a lot more about the HTML DOM in our 
JavaScript tutorial.
All XML elements can be accessed through the XML DOM.The XML DOM is:In other words: The XML DOM is a standard for how to get, change, add, or delete XML elements.This code retrieves the text value of the first <title> element in an 
XML document:The XML file used in the examples below is books.xml.This example reads "books.xml" into xmlDoc and retrieves the text value of the first <title> element in 
books.xml:This example loads a text string into an XML DOM object, and  
extracts the info from it with JavaScript:The DOM models XML as a set of node objects. The nodes can be accessed with 
JavaScript or other programming languages. In this tutorial we use JavaScript.The programming interface to the DOM is defined by a set standard properties 
and methods.Properties are often referred to as something that is (i.e. nodename 
is "book").Methods are often referred to as something that is done (i.e. delete 
"book").These are some typical DOM properties:Note: In the list above, x is a node object.Note: In the list above, x is a node object.

XMLYour message has been sent to W3Schools.An XML Schema describes the structure of an XML document.The XML Schema language is also referred to as XML Schema Definition (XSD).The purpose of an XML Schema is to define the legal building blocks of an XML
document:In the XML world, hundreds of standardized XML formats are in daily use. Many of these XML standards are defined by XML Schemas.XML Schema is an XML-based (and more powerful) alternative to DTD.One of the greatest strength of XML Schemas is the support for data types.Another great strength about XML Schemas is that they are written in XML.XML Schemas are extensible, because they are written in XML.With an extensible Schema definition you can:When sending data from a sender to a receiver, it is essential that both parts
have the same "expectations" about the content.With XML Schemas, the sender can describe the data in a way that the receiver
will understand.A date like: "03-11-2004" will, in some countries, be interpreted as 3.November
and in other countries as 11.March.However, an XML element with a data type
like this:<date type="date">2004-03-11</date>ensures a mutual understanding of the content, because the XML data type "date"
requires the format "YYYY-MM-DD".A well-formed XML document is a document that conforms to the XML syntax
rules, like:Even if documents are well-formed they can still contain errors, and those errors can have serious consequences.Think of the following situation: you order 5 gross of laser printers, instead of 5 laser
printers. With XML Schemas, most of these errors can be caught by your
validating software.

RED ,
GREEN ,
BLUE ).Each parameter defines the intensity of the color as an integer between 0 and 255.For example, rgb(0,0,255) is rendered as blue, 
because the blue parameter is set to its highest value (255) and the others are set to 0.Shades of gray are often defined using equal values for all the 3 light sources:Hexadecimal color values are also supported in all browsers.A hexadecimal color is specified with:
#RRGGBB.RR (red), GG (green) and BB (blue) are hexadecimal integers between 00 and 
FF specifying the intensity of the color.For example, #0000FF is displayed as blue, because the blue component is set to its highest value (FF) and the others are set to 
00.Shades of gray are often defined using equal values for all the 3 light sources:You can use upper case or lower case letters to specify hexadecimal values.
Lower case are easier to write. Upper case are easier to read.CSS supports 140 standard color names.In the next chapter you will find a complete alphabetical list of color names

The character encoding for the early web was ASCII.Later, from HTML 2.0 to HTML 4.01, ISO-8859-1 was 
considered the standard.With XML and HTML5, UTF-8 finally arrived and solved a lot of character encoding problems.Computer data is stored as binary codes (01000101) in the electronics.To standardize the storing of text, the American Standard Code for Information 
Interchange (ASCII) was created. It defined a unique binary number for 
each storable character to support the numbers from 0-9, the upper and lower case alphabet (a-z, A-Z), and special 
characters like ! $ + - ( ) @ < > , .Since ASCII used 7 bits for the character, it could only represent 128 different characters.The biggest weakness with ASCII, was that it excluded non English letters.ASCII is still in use today, especially in large mainframe computer systems.For a closer look, please study our Complete ASCII 
Reference.Windows-1252 was the default character-set in Windows, up to Windows 95.It is an extension to ASCII, with added international characters.It

and electronic devices.ASCII is a 7-bit character set containing 128 characters.It contains the numbers from 0-9, the upper and lower case English letters 
from A to Z, and some special characters.The character sets used in modern computers, in HTML, and on the Internet, 
are all based on ASCII.The following tables list the 128 ASCII characters and their equivalent 
number.The ASCII control characters (range 00-31, plus 127) were designed to control 
hardware devices.Control characters (except horizontal tab, line feed, and carriage return) 
have nothing to do inside an HTML document.

XMLYour message has been sent to W3Schools.Windows-1252 was the first default character set in Microsoft Windows.It was the most popular character set in Windows from 1985 to 1990.Historically, the term "ANSI Code Pages" was used in Windows to refer to non-DOS character sets.The intention was that these character sets would be ANSI standards like ISO-8859-1.Even though Windows-1252 is almost identical to ISO-8859-1, it has never been an ANSI 
or ISO standard.The first part of Windows-1252 (entity numbers from 0-127) is the original ASCII 
character-set. It contains numbers, upper and lowercase English letters, and 
some special characters.For a closer look, please study our Complete 
ASCII Reference.The control characters (range 00-31, plus 127) were designed to control

XMLYour message has been sent to W3Schools.ISO-8859-1 was the default character in HTML 4.01.ISO (The International Standards Organization) defines the standard character 
sets for different alphabets/languages.The different variants of ISO-8859 are listed at the bottom of this page.The first part of ISO-8859-1 (entity numbers from 0-127) is the original 
ASCII character-set. It contains numbers, upper and lowercase English letters, 
and some special characters.For a closer look, please study our Complete 
ASCII Reference.ISO-8859-1 is very similar to Windows-1252.In ISO-8859-1, the characters from 128 to 159 are not defined. 
 In Windows-1252, the characters from 128 to 159 are used for some useful symbols.For a closer look, please study our Complete ANSI 
(Windows-1252) Reference.Since many web sites declare ISO-8859-1 and use the values from 128 to 159 as if they 
were using Windows-1252, most browsers will display these characters from the Windows-1252 character set instead of nothing.The next part of ISO-8859-1 (codes from 160-191) contains commonly used 
special characters.The higher part of ISO-8859-1 (codes from 192-255, except 215 and 247) 
contains characters used in Western European countries.

The Unicode Consortium develops the Unicode Standard.
Their goal is to replace the existing character sets with its standard Unicode 
Transformation Format (UTF).
The Unicode Standard has become a success and is implemented in 
HTML, XML, Java, JavaScript, E-mail, ASP, PHP, etc. The Unicode standard is also 
supported in many operating systems and all modern browsers.
The Unicode Consortium cooperates with the leading standards development 
organizations, like ISO, W3C, and ECMA.
Unicode can be implemented by different character sets. The most commonly used 
encodings are UTF-8 and UTF-16:
Tip: 
The first 128 characters of Unicode (which correspond one-to-one with ASCII) are 
encoded using a single octet with the same binary value as ASCII, making valid 
ASCII text valid UTF-8-encoded Unicode as well.HTML 4 supports UTF-8. HTML 5 supports 
both UTF-8 and UTF-16!Because the character sets in ISO-8859 were 
limited in size, and not compatible in multilingual environments, the 
Unicode Consortium developed the Unicode Standard.
The Unicode Standard covers (almost) all the characters, punctuations, and symbols in the 
world.
Unicode enables processing, storage, and 
transport of text independent of platform and language.The default character encoding in HTML-5 is UTF-8.If an HTML5 web page uses a different character set than UTF-8, it should be 
specified in the <meta> tag like:Unicode is a character set. UTF-8 is encoding.Unicode is a list of characters with unique decimal numbers (code points). A = 
65, B 
= 66, C = 67, ....This list of decimal numbers represent the string "hello": 104 101 108 108 111Encoding is how these numbers are translated into binary numbers to be stored 
in a computer:UTF-8 encoding will store "hello" like this (binary): 01101000 01100101 01101100 
01101100  01101111Encoding translates numbers into binary. Character 
sets translates characters to numbers.Below is a list of some of the UTF-8 character codes supported by HTML5:
